# Building Modern Web Applications with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 has revolutionized the way we build modern web applications. With its powerful App Router, improved performance, and developer experience enhancements, it's become the go-to framework for React developers.

## Key Features of Next.js 14

### 1. App Router Stability

The App Router is now stable and production-ready, offering:

- **Server Components** by default
- **Nested routing** with layouts
- **Loading states** and error boundaries
- **Parallel routes** for complex UIs

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### 2. Improved Performance

Next.js 14 brings significant performance improvements:

- **Faster bundling** with Turbopack
- **Optimized images** with automatic WebP/AVIF conversion
- **Edge runtime** support for better global performance

### 3. Server Actions

Server Actions allow you to run server-side code directly from your components:

```tsx
async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  
  const title = formData.get('title')
  // Save to database
}

export default function CreatePost() {
  return (
    <form action={createPost}>
      <input name="title" type="text" />
      <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components** when possible for better performance
2. **Implement proper error boundaries** for resilient UIs
3. **Optimize images** using Next.js Image component
4. **Leverage caching** strategies for data fetching

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a major step forward in React development. Its focus on performance, developer experience, and modern web standards makes it an excellent choice for any web application.

The combination of Server Components, improved bundling, and powerful routing makes Next.js 14 a framework that truly scales with your application needs.
